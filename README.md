The first project is a comprehensive visualization of airline passenger satisfaction data, designed to get insights and trends that influence the travel experience.
With the aid of charts, graphs, the project highlights factors such as flight punctuality, comfort, and customer support, which collectively shape passenger satisfaction levels for each degree.
The visualizations are crafted to provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the data, enabling stakeholders to identify areas of improvement and make data-driven decisions.
Whether it's analyzing the correlation between seat comfort and satisfaction ratings or comparing performance across different airlines, this project offers a dynamic and engaging way to explore the complexities of passenger feedback.
Tools Used:
- Data Visualization Tools: Tableau, Power BI, or Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly).
- Data Processing: Python (Pandas, NumPy).
- Dataset: Airline passenger satisfaction survey data.

  
The second project is a data-driven exploration of film genres to determine which ones resonate most with audiences. Using a dataset of movie ratings, reviews, and metadata, the notebook analyzes trends in viewer preferences to identify the most beloved genres. With statistical analysis and visualizations, the project uncovers insights into what makes certain genres more popular than others and how audience preferences evolve over time
Tools Used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
